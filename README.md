# Portfolio

### Hello world, I am ℓn(ℯ). Well, Eleni.

In this portfolio, you will be able to explore some of my thoughts, projects I have worked on and I am working on, and generally, a glimpse into my life.

I’m a writer and thinker exploring the intersections of technology, philosophy, psychology, economics, and politics. My work is driven by a deep curiosity about how we understand the world and how we might improve it.

I write to make sense of complexity: to connect ideas across disciplines, question assumptions, and uncover the human side of systems we often take for granted. Whether I’m thinking about AI alignment, the psychology of decision-making, or the philosophical roots of political institutions, my goal is to engage with ideas in a way that’s thoughtful, accessible, and rooted in a desire for positive change.

My current focus is on themes like AI and human values, cooperation and alignment, and the Role of Systems; whether that is economic, political, and technological in shaping behavior and belief.

I believe in interdisciplinary thinking, slow questions, and the power of writing to create clarity in a noisy world. Through essays, notes, and ongoing projects, I hope to share what I’m learning and spark meaningful conversations about the future we’re building together.
